			<p>We do not recommend killing or harming unicorns, but hunting for them can be a lot of fun. To do that you will need an official “Unicorn Hunting License”. You can get your own Unicorn Hunting License for free at the Lake Superior University. This license is good for a lifetime (and beyond) and can be used anywhere on earth.</p>
